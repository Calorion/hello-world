# hello-world
This is my basic, tutorial repository. Who knows what I'll use it for?

This GitHub thing is interesting. It occurs to me that it could be used for many things other than code; writing, for instance.

Anyway, I'm Jim. I'm a computer nerd from way back who nonetheless never actually managed to get into programming. Hopefully that will change soon.

However, the reason I'm using GitHub at the moment is that I want to add sites to Two Factor Auth.
